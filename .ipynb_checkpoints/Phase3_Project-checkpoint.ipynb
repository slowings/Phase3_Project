    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "For the Phase 3 final project we will develop a model to predict water well failure in Tanzania using information gathered by the Tanzanian government and hosted as a competition by DrivenData.  We'll depart from the competition to address the needs of our client, a local NGO working with an international funding partner to locate the wells at greatest risk of failure in order to determine which geographic regions to direct their funding towards.

    "## Business Understanding\n",
    "Tanzania faces an increased demand for water based on population growth projections, as well as increased contamination of groundwater storage from mining and agricultural runoff.  Additionally, the city of Dar-Es-Salaam is subject to frequent chollera outbreaks due to well water contamination from human run-off.  A third threat is posed by changing climate conditions that have shifted rainfall patterns, causing storms producing more intense rainfall and increased flooding, leaving less water to filter into the underground aquafers and lakes from which the wells draw from.  As a result, both well safety and dropping water tables will also be taken into account when determining which water sources will reamin viable for human and agricultural usage.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to clarify that the word well can mean many things in this dataset, from complex mechanicanical pump sites with extensive filtration to a hand pump that brings up untreated groundwater.    \n",
    "\n",
    "Some key factors we will take into account:\n",
    "__Pollution__- Which water points have harmful concentrations of pollutants\n",
    "\n",
    "__Population__- Which water points have the highest population density\n",
    "\n",
    "__Salinization__- Which water points are at greatest risk from sea level rise\n",
    "\n",
    "__Sanitation__- Which water points are at greatest risk\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "We are given 40 independant variables (columns) from which to base our predictive model on.  There are 59,400 entries (or wells) in our training data and 14,850 in our test data. Our target feature, water_quality, has 32259 wells listed as \"functional\", 4317 wells as \"in need of repair, and 22824 wells listed as\"non-functional\" \n",

    "We'll be taking a closer look at the many independant variables here to narrow down the number of columns we use in our models.  Certain features will be easy to elimate, such as payment type, or recorded by (identifies the org. who collected the data) which will have no bearing on well functionality.  Additionally, many of the columns appear to repeat the same information, which could lead to correlation/dependency between the predictors, as well as overfitting in our model.  Therefore, narrowing down our choices will be important to the accuracy and efficacy of our model.  We will obviously want key factors, like water quality, but we'll also look at things like well depth, altitude, and source type to determine the long term viability and functionality of each well.  With sea levels rising, coastal Tanzania will be especially succeptable to salinization of it's ground water tables. There's also increading arridity in it's interior, as well as changes in rain patterns that are leading to less recharging of those aquafers.  As a result, factors like well depth, location, and source type will also be important to consider."
