# Phase 3 Final Project: Identifying Faulty Water Wells
## Introduction
For the Phase 3 final project we will develop a model to predict water well failure in Tanzania using information gathered by the Tanzanian government and hosted as a competition by DrivenData. We'll depart from the competition to address the needs of our client, a local NGO working with an international funding partner to locate the wells at greatest risk of failure in order to determine which geographic regions to direct their funding towards.

## Water Management
Tanzania faces an increased demand for water based on population growth projections.  To meet the needs of this growing population they have transferred water rights and management to national and regional authorities.  These municipalities face many challenges, such as increased contamination of groundwater storage from mining and agricultural runoff, frequent chollera outbreaks, and naturally occuring floride deposits in hazardous quantities.  Additionally, there are threats posed by changing climate conditions that have shifted rainfall patterns, causing storms producing more intense rainfall and increased flooding, leaving less water to filter into the underground aquafers and lakes from which the wells draw from- compounding this is more recent multi-year drought cycles.  As a result, paradoxically, this flood prone country faces increasing water shortages.   

It's important to clarify that the word well can mean many things in this dataset, from complex mechanicanical pump sites with extensive filtration to a hand pump that brings up untreated groundwater (water from lakes, rivers, and streams).

Some key factors we will take into account:

__Pollution__- Which water points have harmful concentrations of pollutants

__Population__- Which water points have the highest population density

__Salinization__- Which water points are at greatest risk from sea level rise

__Sanitation__- Which water points are at greatest risk for contamination from human run-off
